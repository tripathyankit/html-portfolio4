<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Ankit Tripathy a b.tech student pursuing my career as an software engineer in 
  SUIIT(Sambalpur University Institute of Informatiopnal Technology) which is in west odisha, 
  I have completed my schooling from st.Arnold's jhartarang raurkela. </p>

<p>I have always been curious in tech and never stop searching my curiousity in every thing ,
  I love to learn new things and very diciplined in my work if I decide to do something 
  I make sure I complete it by heart. So just by my curiousity I found this course in udemy
  which is interesting so I started my journey to become a web developer.</p>

<p>I'll make sure to note my weakness and work on it and become an professional web developer
  in near future I'll make an interesting and advance project which will help the society
  and as well as help me grow as a software developer.</p>
